# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing a customer churn dataset from a telecom company named "Neo." The primary objective is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to build various machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn.

## Features

*   **Data Manipulation:** The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and manipulated to prepare it for analysis and modeling.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of different features and their relationships with customer churn.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Several machine learning models are implemented to predict customer churn, including:
    *   Linear Regression
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Decision Tree
    *   Random Forest
*   **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
