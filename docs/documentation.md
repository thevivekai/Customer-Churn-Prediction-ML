# Documentation for Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This document provides a brief overview of the project and its implementation.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a customer churn dataset from a telecom company named "Neo." The primary objective is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to build various machine learning models to predict whether a customer will churn.

## Implementation Details

The project is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook: `P2_ML_Customer_Churn.ipynb`.

The notebook is structured as follows:

1.  **Data Manipulation:** The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed.
2.  **Data Visualization:** Various plots are created to visualize the data and understand the relationships between different variables.
3.  **Linear Regression:** A simple linear regression model is built to predict monthly charges based on tenure.
4.  **Logistic Regression:** Simple and multiple logistic regression models are built to predict customer churn.
5.  **Decision Tree:** A decision tree classifier is built to predict churn.
6.  **Random Forest:** A random forest classifier is built to predict churn.

## How to Use

To run the project, open the `P2_ML_Customer_Churn.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.
